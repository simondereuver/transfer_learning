# transfer_learning

## Introduction
This repository uses the Cats vs Dogs and Stanford Dogs dataset, the goal is to to train CNN's and explore transfer learning in Keras.

## Datasets
The datasets can be aquired [Cats vs Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishnupriyanss/cat-vs-dog-kagglecatsanddogs-5340) and [Stanford dogs](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/stanford_dogs) here.

## Enviroment
Create a Python virtual enviroment and run pip install -r requirements.txt to create the enviroment required to run the code. Recommended is Cuda 12.5 and Tensorflow 2.19.0 as that has been used in this project. Run: ```python3 -m pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'```
